# Example Custom Package

I can create custom R packages to do a variety of tasks for you or your team. 

Often there are tasks that need to be done over and over in R. By wrapping these in functions in a custom R package this process can be streamlined, and also well documented with a detailed help file. 

Custom R packages can also be a way of sharing data within a group, if the package is hosted on a service like github. These packages can be public or private and can be tailored to your group's needs.
